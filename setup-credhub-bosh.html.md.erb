This topic provides details about how to deploy a BOSH Director with CredHub so that you can use credential variables in your deployment manifests.

If you use [bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment), include the file `credhub.yml` to enable CredHub on the BOSH Director VM.

## <a name="how-it-works"></a> How It Works

CredHub exists co-located on a virtual machine (VM) with the Director, UAA, and other high-level components. A deployment manifest configured with variables calls to Credhub which then passes the credential to the appropriate components.

Once configured, any variable in a BOSH deployment manifest with the syntax <code>((variable-name))</code> causes the Director to retrieve the variable value from CredHub at deploy time. You can tell your manifest already uses CredHub if fields with secure data have <code>((variables))</code> formatted with double parentheses.

## <a name="setup"></a> Setup Before Deployment

1. Set up BOSH Director.<br/><br>
The following configuration steps assume that you have an existing BOSH Director. If you do not have a Director, read the [initialization guide](https://bosh.io/docs/init.html) for more details.

1. Configure UAA on your Director.<br/><br>
CredHub uses UAA for user and client authentication. You need a UAA server configured on the Director to enable CredHub. For more information about provisioning UAA on the Director, read [the BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa.html).

1. **(Optional)** Configure an external database.<br/><br>
To optimize fault tolerance, store CredHub data in an external database. To do so, you must create a database and user on your database server before deployment. You can use the internal Director database to store CredHub data, but take care to avoid data loss when you provision or update the Director VM.

1. **(Optional)** Configure a Luna HSM.<br/><br>
If you use an external Hardware Security Module (HSM) to perform cryptographic operations:
    * Configure the HSM to allow access from the deployed CredHub instance, and
    * Grant the operator all of the required permissions to use the HSM.
    <br><br>
    For more information about the required HSM values and how to configure an HSM, read about [configuring a Luna HSM](./hsm-config.html).

## <a name="configure"></a> Configuring the Director
<ol>
<li>Update the deployment manifest to include the CredHub release. <a href="https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release?all=1">Download the latest CredHub release from bosh.io</a>.</li>

<pre>
    releases:
    - name: bosh
      url: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh?v=261.2
      version: 261.2
      sha1: d4635b4b82b0dc5fd083b83eb7e7405832f6654b
    # ...
    - name: credhub # <---
      url: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release?v=0.6.1
      version: 0.6.1
      sha1: 5ab4c4ef3d67f8ea07d78b1a87707e7520a97ab7
</pre>

<li>Add the CredHub job to the Director instance.</li>

<pre>
    instance_groups:
    - name: bosh
      instances: 1
      jobs:
      - {name: nats, release: bosh}
      - {name: redis, release: bosh}
      - {name: postgres, release: bosh}
      - {name: blobstore, release: bosh}
      - {name: director, release: bosh}
      - {name: health_monitor, release: bosh}
      - {name: uaa, release: uaa-release}
      - {name: credhub, release: credhub} # <---
      resource_pool: default
      # ...
</pre>

<li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Add variable generation specifications for CredHub properties.<br/><br>

You can generate values that CredHub requires automatically with the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli">BOSH v2 CLI</a>. To enable generation, add the variable specifications to the manifest as shown below. You can adjust or remove these if you prefer to provide your own values.
</li>
<pre>
    variables:
    - name: credhub-ca
      type: certificate
      options:
        is_ca: true
        common_name: 'CredHub CA'
    - name: credhub-tls
      type: certificate
      options:
        ca: credhub-ca
        common_name: credhub.example.com
        alternative_names:
        - 10.0.0.10
        - 127.0.0.1
    - name: credhub-encryption-password
      type: password
</pre>

<li>Add CredHub properties to the deployment manifest.

<pre>
    properties:
      credhub:
        port: 8844
        log_level: info
        tls:
          certificate: ((credhub-tls.certificate))
          private_key: ((credhub-tls.private_key))
        data_storage:
          type: mysql
          host: mysql.EXAMPLE.com
          port: 3306
          database: credhub
          username: user
          password: EXAMPLE-PASSWORD
          require_tls: true
          tls_ca: |
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            ...
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        authentication:
          uaa:
            url: "https://uaa.example.com:8443"
            verification_key: |
              -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
              ...
              -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
          mutual_tls:
            trusted_cas:
            - |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

        encryption:
          keys:
          - provider_name: corp-hsm
            encryption_key_name: KEY-NAME
            active: true
          providers:
          - name: corp-hsm
            type: hsm
            partition: PARTITION-NAME
            partition_password: PARTITION-PASSWORD
            client_certificate: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            client_key: |
              -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
              ...
              -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            servers:
            - host: hsm.example.com
              port: 1792
              partition_serial_number: 123456
              certificate: |
                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                ...
                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>

The example above includes a configuration to use a hardware security module (HSM) for encryption. Alternatively, you can use the internal software-based encryption provider with the configuration below.</br><br>

This method derives a 256-bit key from the provided encryption password and utilized AES256-GCM encryption.

<pre>
    ...
      encryption:
        providers:
        - name: main
          type: internal
        keys:
        - provider_name: main
          encryption_password: ((credhub-encryption-password))
          active: true
    ...
</pre>

For the full list of CredHub properties and default values, read the <a href="https://bosh.io/jobs/credhub?source=github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release">job spec properties</a>.
</li>
<li>Add CredHub CLI and Director/CredHub UAA clients.</li>

<pre>
    properties:
      uaa:
        clients:
          credhub_cli:
            override: true
            authorized-grant-types: password,refresh_token
            scope: credhub.read,credhub.write
            authorities: uaa.none
            access-token-validity: 120
            refresh-token-validity: 1800
            secret: "" # <--- CLI expects this secret to be empty
          director_to_credhub:
            override: true
            authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
            scope: uaa.none
            authorities: credhub.read,credhub.write
            access-token-validity: 43200
            secret: EXAMPLE-SECRET # <--- Replace with custom client secret
</pre>

<li>Enable the config server on the Director and configure it to utilize CredHub.</li>

<pre>
    properties:
      director:
        address: bosh.EXAMPLE.com
        name: director-name
        config_server:
          enabled: true

          # URL must contain /api/ path with trailing slash
          url: "https://127.0.0.1:8844/api/"

          ca_cert: |
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            ...
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          uaa:
            url: "https://127.0.0.1:8443"
            client_id: director_to_credhub
            client_secret: EXAMPLE-SECRET
            ca_cert: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>

<li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Configure the Director Postgres server with additional database named <code>credhub</code>.

If you are using the internal Director database, you must provision an additional database for the CredHub data. If you use an external database, you must create the database on your database server before deploying.
</li>
<pre>
    properties:
      postgres: &db
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 5432
        user: postgres
        password: POSTGRES-PASSWORD
        database: bosh
        additional_databases: [credhub]
        adapter: postgres
</pre>

<li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Seed initial CredHub users to UAA.</li>

<pre>
    properties:
      uaa:
        scim:
          users:
          - name: CREDHUB-USER
            password: USER-PASSWORD
            groups:
            # Users must have both credhub.read and credhub.write access
            - credhub.read             # <---
            - credhub.write            # <---
          - name: OTHER-CREDHUB-USER
            password: OTHER-USER-PASSWORD
            groups:
            - credhub.read
            - credhub.write
</pre>

<li>Deploy.</li>
</ol>

## <a name="using-credhub"></a>Using CredHub

<ol>
<li>Create CredHub users in UAA.
<br><br>
To authenticate with CredHub to manage credentials, you must have a UAA user account with the scopes `credhub.read` and `credhub.write`. You can create users in UAA as described <a href="../uaa/uaa-user-management.html">in the UAA documentation</a>. Alternatively, you can configure UAA with an <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-LDAP.md">external LDAP provider</a>.
<br><br>
The example below shows how to create two users in UAA.
</li>
<pre class="terminal">
$ uaac token client get admin -s example-password
  Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
  Target: https<span>:</span>//uaa.EXAMPLE.com:8443
  Context: admin, from client admin<br/>
$ uaac user add EXAMPLE-USER --emails email<span>@</span>example.com
  Password:  ********
  Verify password:  ********
  user account successfully added<br/>
$ uaac user add OTHER-EXAMPLE-USER --emails email<span>@</span>example.com
  Password:  ********
  Verify password:  ********
  user account successfully added<br/>
$ uaac member add credhub.read EXAMPLE-USER OTHER-EXAMPLE-USER
  success<br/>
$ uaac member add credhub.write EXAMPLE-USER OTHER-EXAMPLE-USER
  success
</pre>

<li>Install the CredHub CLI.<br/><br><br>

The CredHub CLI offers a simple, scriptable interface to manage stored credentials. You can download the latest release from the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub-cli/releases">GitHub repository</a>.
</li>
<li>Place or generate credentials in CredHub using the CLI.</li>

<pre class="terminal">
$ credhub set --type ssh --name /static/ssh_key --public ~/ssh.pub --private ~/ssh.key
$ credhub generate --type ssh --name /static/ssh_key
</pre>

<li>Update BOSH deployment manifests.<br/><br>

Once you have a Director that integrates with CredHub, you can update your deployment manifests to use it. The example below is of a deployment manifest using two credentials; one stored in Credhub, and one generated by CredHub. <br/><br>

Define credentials that you want to be generated automatically in the <code>variables</code> section.
</li>
<pre>

                    ssh\_keys:
                      - ((/static/ssh\_key))
                      - ((generated/ssh\_key))
</pre>
