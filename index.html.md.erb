This topic gives an overview of the purpose and functionality of the CredHub component.

CredHub is a component designed for centralized credential management in <%= vars.platform_name %>. It is a single
component that can address several scenarios in the <%= vars.platform_name %> ecosystem. At the highest level, CredHub
centralizes and secures credential generation, storage, lifecycle management, and access.


## <a name="what-can-it-do"></a> Functions

CredHub performs a number of different functions to help generate and protect the credentials in your
<%= vars.platform_name %> deployment:

* Securing data for storage
* Authentication
* [Authorization and Permissions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub/blob/main/docs/authorization-and-permissions.md)
* Access and change logging
* Data typing
* Credential generation
* Credential metadata
* Credential versioning

## <a name="application-architecture"></a> App Architecture

CredHub consists of a REST API and a CLI. CredHub is an OAuth2
resource server that integrates with User Account Authentication (UAA) to provide core authentication and federation
capabilities.

## <a name="pcfcredhub"></a> CredHub in <%= vars.platform_name %>

A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment stores credentials in these locations:

* **BOSH CredHub**: Colocated with the BOSH Director on a single VM. This CredHub instance stores credentials for the BOSH Director.

* **Runtime CredHub**: Deployed as an independent service and stores service instance credentials.

### <a name="bosh"></a> BOSH CredHub

In <%= vars.platform_name %>, the BOSH Director VM includes a CredHub job. This provides a lightweight credential storage instance for the BOSH Director. The BOSH Director, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), and other tiles store credentials in BOSH CredHub. For more information, see _Retrieve Credentials Stored in BOSH CredHub_ in _Retrieving Credentials from Your Deployment_.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This configuration does not provide high availability.</p>

In this colocated deployment architecture, the BOSH Director, CredHub, UAA, and the BOSH Director database are all installed on a single BOSH VM, as shown in the diagram below:

![Diagram that show the following components colocated on the BOSH VM: BOSH Director, CredHub, UAA, and the BOSH Director database](images/bosh-deployment.png)

### <a name="runtime"></a> Runtime CredHub

The <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile deploys CredHub as an independent service on its own VM. This provides a highly available credential storage instance for securing service instance credentials. For more information, see [Securing Service Instance Credentials with Runtime CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-12/operating/secure-si-creds.html).

CredHub is a stateless app, so you can scale it to multiple instances that share a common database cluster and encryption provider.

With CredHub as a service, the load balancer and external databases communicate directly with the CredHub VMs, as shown in the diagram below:

![Diagram that shows multiple CredHub VMs that connect to UAA, an HSM, an external database, and a load balancer. The load balancer connects to four consumer VMs.](images/service-deployment.png)


## <a id='store-creds'></a> Using CredHub to Store Credentials for Service Tiles

If you develop a service tile for <%= vars.platform_name %> and want to store its credentials in BOSH CredHub, see [CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/credhub.html) in _<%= vars.platform_name %> Tile Developer Guide_.
<% end %>


## <a name="cred-types"></a> CredHub Credential Types

Credentials exist in multiple places.
Components use credentials to authenticate connections between components.
Installations often have hundreds of active credentials.
Leaked credentials are common causes of data and security breaches, so managing them securely is very important.

For more information, see [CredHub Credential Types](credential-types.html).

## <a name="backup-restore"></a> Backing Up and Restoring CredHub Instances

CredHub does not hold state, but you must ensure its dependent components are backed up. Redundant backups can help
prevent data loss if an individual component fails. For more information, see
[Backing Up and Restoring CredHub Instances](backup-restore.html).
